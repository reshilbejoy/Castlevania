# Castlevania III Remix - 1980's Game Project

Our project is a 2D action platformer game based on the NES Castlevania video game. 

## Overview

Castlevania III is a 2D action/story-based platformer game, released in 1989. The game takes a player through various stages to ultimately achieve an end goal. Throughout the game, various obstacles, include platforms and enemies, obstruct the player's path. Other items, like candles and weapons, help the player traverse through the map. The game has a tight movement system to keep the difficulty high and prevent rapid progression. There is a simply weapon inventory, and some form of interaction about every 3 seconds. Additionally, there are objects scattered around the map that the user must find in order to more easily progress through difficult stages. 

In replicating Castlevania, we made two major twists. The first is our storyline. The original Castlevania III revolved around Trevor Belmont hunting down Draculas in 15th Century Europe. We implemented a Hansel & Gretel theme (from the Brothers' Grimm). The pair are searching for food amidst a famine when they are captured by a witch, and seperated. Gretel finds herself trapped in a dungeon, needing to escape and find her brother. By changing the storyline, we needed to change the artwork for the background, characters, and sprites, to match the story. We maintained the dark tone of the original Castlevania III, as it matched the storyline of Hansel & Gretel. Our second twist was to change the physics system. The original Castlevania is extremely rigid: there is a fixed speed, a very strong gravitational force, and limited movement in the air. We wanted to replicate a real-world physics system, which meant implementing a friction force, along with a weaker gravitational force. This allows the player to accelerate, decelerate, and slide. The player can also jump to higher platforms; however, movement in the air is still prohibited to preserve that element from the original game. 

When designing the game, we initially sought to make one large level that demonstrated aspects of the entire Castlevania game. This includes platforms, interactable objects, enemies, and a final boss. However, when discussing the user-experience, we felt that seperating these aspects into multiple levels would allow a player to 'discover' how to move and feel out the game. So, we created multiple levels. The initial ones involve basic movement and interactions, with each subsequent level including new game features (like platforms) and more advanced enemies. Thelevels are connected through doors, which are placed at the end of the stage. We also included the score box at the top of the screen from the original game, along with an opening and closing window, and a screen that explains the game controls. These were choices that make a user feel like they are playing a developed and released game. 

To run the game, you will need to run the **Main.py** file in the **main** branch. If the window is too big for your screen, you can adjust the variable **size** in Constants/window_constants.py. ***Do not change any other variable in this file!*** The window will have instructions on how to move through the game with a keyboard. At the end of the game, simply close the window and re-run the program if you want to play again.

## User Experience

There is a good chance a first-time user is actually quite comfortable with the game. The platformer aspects of Castlevania, although not exactly the same, can be seen in popular games, like Geometry Dash. A first-time user will probably understand to move throughout the stage and interact with objects on the map. However, the user will have to discover certain interactions through the game, such as destroying candles to gain extra health. Information on how to use certain commands is given at the start, but the purpose of features like attacking and sliding is not explicitly stated. This is intended to preserve the exploratory feel of the original Castlevania. The goal of our game is for a first-time user to not feel overwhelmed by the game mechanics, but to have to figure out how to progress through difficult stages. 

As said before, there is an element of mystery to the game. A more experienced player would understand how certain interactions work in order to progress through stages quicker. In some ways, the player isn't really supposed to know what to do. Instead, they have to realize that in order to accrue the necessary score, and preserve their health, they need to move in a way where they can attack enemies and stay safe. Additionally, a new user will have to figure out through repeated gameplay that they need to run before jumping, or move while attacking. While they might seem confusing, these aspects allow a new player to feel like they are discovering game elements, and thus gain the feeling that they overcame the challenges of the game. 

An experienced user will have a completely different experience. During our testing, we had friends try out the game to see how their skill improved. Many of them had trouble on their initial attempts in staying alive and not jumping off platforms. However, after they completed the first stage, they were much more comfortable with movement and attacking patterns. While the new enemies and terrain presented a challenge, it was easier for them to play because they understood the game mechanics. When a player wants to play the entire game again, they will meet the same maps (something true in the original Castlevania). As a result, the motive for an experienced player is to improve a high score or to finish the game in less time. This will allow an experienced player to focus on subtle ways to gain an advantage in the game. 

Unfortunately, because we don't have the same amount of levels as the original Castlevania, the re-playability of our game is not as high. A player might want to come back to improve their high score or to finish the game faster. In many platformer games, the lure of "speed-running" or getting the highest score is what brings players back. That would be the case for our remake of Castlevania. 

## Retrospective
How did you feel about the process of writing this app?

The process of writing our game was challenging but very fun. We started by creating a **TestingFramework** branch to play around with ideas and figure out how certain game elements would work. Simultaneously, we worked on creating a Zero Feature Release to organize our classes and plan out the framework of the game. This was an extremely useful step, as it made development in the latter stages of the project really streamlined and efficient. We did encounter some problems because the way we had approached features in the testing branch didn't mesh with the ZFR, which meant we had to re-think some of our design. Overall, by planning and developing functions within the context of the ZFR, we were able to efficiently develop our game. 

What was communication like? High points? Low points?

The communication was handled surprisingly well. There were rarely points where we had significant merge issues, or people didn't know what they were supposed to be doing. What helped us the most was creating detailed **Issues** in Github when we first started, and creating a personal **Discord** server, where all the communications regarding the project were handled. We had several channels, where people could conference about specific issues (such as Art, Architecture and etc.). One of the high points  was when we all gathered for a quick meeting during one of the Snow Days, as it showed how dedicated each and every one of us ware to finishing the Project and making sure that it was of good quality. That is not to say that we didn't have any communication issues whatsoever. We had a bit of a struggle with the architecture, as the person who had created the ZFR initially was the one who had done all of the work on it, and the only one who knew exactly how everything worked and connected. It was a bit of struggle for a time making sure that everyone else was up to speed and understood exactly what was supposed to go where.

Were there any major surprises you encountered?

One of the major surprises we encountered was how little time we actually had to get everything done. Originally, we had much bigger plans for the Game, such as making more levels, bosses and enemy variations. However, we have grossely underestimated the amount of time it takes to create Sprtites and Animation for everything, as well as the amount of detail and care that we would have to put in into our **Code** and **Classes**. Somewhere around past the two months mark after we started working on this project, we realised we would have to make cuts to our initial plans, and we had to sit down and figure out what exactly we were ready to sacrifice. This threw a wrench into our plans, as our original concepts were pretty tightly knit and it was hard to figure out what ideas we could safely remove without having to re-do evertything. Next time, we will be a lot more prepared from the beginning for such a turn of events, and make plans based on the fact that some of the details might have to be removed later-on in the process.

Is there anything you would do differently next time?

Next time, we would have a lot more understanding of how this type of Game Functions, and what specific parts are the most important ones to get done at the start. We would probably streamline the process more and learn from out current mistakes, and re-do some of the architecture so it is more refined and has unecessary repetitions. We would also add more replayability (aka more levels, enemies and weapons), as well as some things from the original Castlevania that we did not have enough time to implement now (like Stairs). Most importantly, we would spend more time Play Testing the game, and ironing out all the bugs.
